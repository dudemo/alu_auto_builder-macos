####Build Instructions

Copy this entire directory to the same path as the executable created by cx_freeze when building for WINDOWS.

Then download the unsupported Windows version of Skysraper [from here](https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper) and place in a directory called 'skyscraper' (all lower-case) in the 'windows' directory you have just copied:

- \aluautobuild_gui.exe
- \windows\\\[all the dlls, exes etc in the same dir as this readme]
- \windows\skyscraper\\\[Skyscraper.exe and all the other files in the same folder from the release zip file]
