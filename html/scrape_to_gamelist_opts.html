<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Dir:</b> <i>Required</i> A directory containing one/multiple roms for a single emulated system.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> The directory in which the gamelist.xml and a 'media' directory containing
        downloaded covers will be placed. If one isn't provided it will be created in the same directory as the roms.</li>
    <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the roms belong to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose 'mame-libretro').
    Just because a platform is listed here it doesn't mean an appropriate core exists. It's been left on the long side
        as a modest nod to future-proofing.</li>
    <li><b>Scrape Module</b> <i>Required</i> The online source from which to scrape metadata. Each has a website if you
    need to know more. Some (e.g. the superb screenscraper) work a lot faster with a user account. arcadedb is excellent,
        requires no account but as the name suggests is relevant mostly for arcade roms.</li>
    <li><b>User Name</b> <i>Optional</i> A user name if you are using a module for which you have an account.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> <i>Optional</i> A password for any user account.</li>
    <li><b>Refresh Rom Data</b> <i>Optional</i> Select to re-download metadata and images for input roms. Do this if
        the tool is not producing a folder of marquees as expected.</li>
</ul>
