    <li><b>Export Cox Assets</b> <i>Optional</i> Export a folder of assets which can be directly copied to a USB
        stick for use wit CoinOpsX. Videos are not guaranteed to work as ATGames products are quite picky about
        video formats.

        BitPixel.

    </li>
    <li><b>Do Summarise Gamelist</b> <i>Optional</i> Choose whether to create files containing lists and a table showing
        what data/assets have been successfully scraped for each game. This is particularly useful when building recipes
        as it lets you determine which need further work before they are built into UCEs.
