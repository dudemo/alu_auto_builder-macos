<h2>Create UCEs from gamelist.xml</h2>
<p><i>This operation requires administrator privileges on Windows</i></p>
<p>Takes an EmulationStation format gamelist.xml (the sort used by RetroPie, amongst others) and uses it to generate
UCE files.</p>
<p>You can use a gamelist.xml produced with this tool or one produced by something else. However, in the latter case,
the gamelist.xml must point to actual roms and covers to work (if you're using it for something else, it probably does).
</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The gamelist.xml file from which to generate the UCEs.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> A directory in which to place the output UCEs. If this is not provided,
    a directory will be created in the same directory as the gamelist.xml (called 'UCE').</li>
    <li><b>Core Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The path to a libretro core (emulator) file compatible with the roms referred
        to in the gamelist.xml</li>
    <li><b>Bios Dir</b> <i>Optional</i> Any files in this directory will be placed in the 'roms' directory within
    the UCE. This is mostly useful for adding the same bios file(s) to all recipes built from the gamelist.xml.</li>
</ul>
