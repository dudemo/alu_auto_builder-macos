<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Dir:</b> <i>Required</i> A directory containing one/multiple roms for a single emulated system.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> The directory in which the output UCE files will be placed. If no directory
        is provided one will be created in the same directory as the roms (called 'UCE').
    </li>
    <li><b>Core Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The path to a libretro core (emulator) file compatible with the roms in the
        input directory.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bios Dir</b> <i>Optional</i> Any files in this directory will be placed in the 'roms' directory within the
        UCE. This is mostly useful for adding the same bios file(s) to all recipes.
    </li>
    <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the roms belong to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose
        'mame-libretro'). Just because a platform is listed here it doesn't mean an appropriate core exists. It's been
        left on the long side as a modest nod to future-proofing.
    </li>
    <li><b>Scrape Module</b> <i>Required</i> The online source from which to scrape metadata. Each has a website if you
        need to know more. Some (e.g. the superb screenscraper) work a lot faster with a user account. arcadedb is
        excellent, requires no account but as the name suggests is relevant mostly for arcade roms.
    </li>
    <li><b>User Name</b> <i>Optional</i> A user name if you are using a module for which you have an account.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> <i>Optional</i> A password for any user account.</li>
    <li><b>Scrape Videos</b> <i>Optional</i> Choose whether to try to download videos when scraping game data. Only
        useful if you want to export CoinOpsX assets.
    </li>
    <li><b>Refresh Rom Data</b> <i>Optional</i> Select this to re-scrape data/assets for roms/games which already have
        data stored from the chosen scraping module. Use this option if you have previously scraped without choosing to
        download videos and would now like to do so. Select this option if marquees are expected by missing.
    </li>
    <li><b>Do Summarise Gamelist</b> <i>Optional</i> Choose whether to create files containing lists and a table showing what data/assets
        have been successfully scraped for each game.
        This is particularly useful when building recipes as it lets you determine which need further work before they
        are built into UCEs.
    </li>
    <li><b>Do Bezel Scrape</b> <i>Optional</i> Scraping bezels is a separate process from the main scrape as bezels are
        not stored by the scraping modules. Select this to additionally scrape bezels from the BezelProject on GitHub
    </li>
    <li><b>Min Match Score</b> <i>Optional</i> Matching rom/game names to bezels is imperfect. Set this option to choose
        how close a match is needed when scraping bezels. Defaults to 85%. If no match is found for a particular rom,
        the
        default bezel for that system will be used.
    </li>
    <li><b>Compare Filename</b> <i>Optional</i> When scraping for bezels, use the rom filename rather than the title
        in the gamelist/returned by the scraping module. This is forced for arcade platforms due to the naming
        convention used by the BezelProject. This option may produce better matches for other platforms if your roms are
        named according to the No-Intro convention.
    </li>
    <li><b>Filter unsupported regions</b> <i>Optional, Recommended</i> The BezelProject does not support games with
        Japanese names and the matcher can return strange results if it tries to search for them. This option will try
        to identify Japanese games and apply the default bezel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Export Cox Assets</b> <i>Optional</i> Export a folder of assets which can be directly copied to a USB
        stick for use wit CoinOpsX. Videos are not guaranteed to work as ATGames products are quite picky about
        video formats.
    </li>
    <li><b>Export BitPixel Marquees</b> <i>Optional</i> Export a folder of marquee files rezixed for use with the
        BitPixel.
        These are in addition to any full size marquees exported for CoinOpsX (if selected).
    </li>
</ul>
