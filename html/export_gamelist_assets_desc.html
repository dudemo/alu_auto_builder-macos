<h2>Export assets from gamelist.xml</h2>

<p>When this tool (or Skyscraper, which does the heavy lifting) creates a gamelist assets will exported to a media
folder next to the gamelist. This option copies those assets to folders properly formatted for CoinOpsX, generates
playlists and playlist title images and exports marquees resized for use with the Bitpixel.</p>

<p>Assets can be exported as part of many of the other scraping and building operations, so this will be rarely
needed on its own.</p>
