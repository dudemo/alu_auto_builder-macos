<h2>Add Bezels to Existing gamelist.xml</h2>

<p>Gamelists created using Skyscraper do not include bezels as these are not stored by the supported scraping modules
(screenscraper, arcadedb etc). Use this operation to add bezels to an existing gamelist which does not have them.</p>

<p>Bezels which are not stored locally will be downloaded.</p>

<p>When you create a gamelist with this tool you can choose to add bezels at the point of creation so this
operation should be needed rarely.</p>
