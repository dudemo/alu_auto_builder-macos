<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The gamelist.xml file to add bezels to.</li>
        <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the gamelist belongs to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose
        'mame-libretro').
    </li>
    <li><b>Min Match Score</b> <i>Optional</i> Matching rom/game names to bezels is imperfect. Set this option to choose
        how close a match is needed when scraping bezels. Defaults to 85%. If no match is found for a particular rom,
        the
        default bezel for that system will be used.
    </li>
    <li><b>Compare Filename</b> <i>Optional</i> When scraping for bezels, use the rom filename rather than the title
        in the gamelist/returned by the scraping module. This is forced for arcade platforms due to the naming
        convention used by the BezelProject. This option may produce better matches for other platforms if your roms are
        named according to the No-Intro convention.
    </li>
    <li><b>Filter unsupported regions</b> <i>Optional, Recommended</i> The BezelProject does not support games with
        Japanese names and the matcher can return strange results if it tries to search for them. This option will try
        to identify Japanese games and apply the default bezel.
    </li>
        <li><b>Do Summarise Gamelist</b> <i>Optional</i> Choose whether to create files containing lists and a table showing what data/assets
        have been successfully scraped for each game.
        This is particularly useful when building recipes as it lets you determine which need further work before they
        are built into UCEs.
    </li>
