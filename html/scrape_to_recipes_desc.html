<h2>Scrape Metadata and Create Recipes</h2>

<p>Provide a directory containing roms and produce 'recipe folders'. The tool uses the excellent Skyscraper under the hood to do
download information and covers for the roms.</p>
<p>This operation is useful where you have a set of roms which you want to turn into UCEs but have some need to tweak
the contents of the UCEs before they are built. This usually means applying a custom save partition. If you don't care
about this and just want UCEs, use 'Scrape To UCEs' from the main menu.</p>
