<h2>Edit Save Partition</h2>
<p><i>Once you have made changes to the save partition in your file manager, you must hit enter in the console
window when prompted to close the partition and complete the process.</i></p>
<p>Allows editing of the contents of a UCE's save partition in your OS's file manager.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The UCE file whose save partition you want to edit.</li>
    <li><b>Mount Method:</b> <i>Optional, Linux only, needs root.</i> If selected, the save partition will be mounted as with any
    other Linux filesystem rather than edited using a combination of debugfs/make2fs commands. There ought to be no
    practical difference; the mount method is mostly a hold-over from early attempts to implement this functionality. A
    small advantage is that you don't have to hit enter in the console window to complete the process. A big disadvantage
    is that you'll need another file manager window opened as root to drag/copy/paste files in and out of the save
    partition.</li>
    <li><b>File Manager</b> <i>Optional, Linux only.</i> Specify a particular file manager application. Otherwise the tool
    works through a list of known file managers until it finds one. The list is not exhaustive so if you are using something
    niche you may need to specify it explicitly.</li>
    <li><b>Backup Uce:</b> <i>Optional</i> Select this option to create a backup of the UCE before any write operations happen.
        It will be created in the same directory as the UCE with the extension '.bak'.</li>
</ul>
