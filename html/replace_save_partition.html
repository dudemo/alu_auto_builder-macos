<h2>Replace Save Partition</h2>
<p>Replaces the existing save partition of a UCE file with another specified by the user.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The UCE file to have its save partition replaced.</li>
    <li><b>Part Path:</b>  <i>Required</i> The raw save partition file which will replace the UCE's existing one. Typically this is a 4Mb file
    called save.img. To work, it must have an internal ext4 filesystem. All UCEs generated with this and other tools
    have such a partition.</li>
