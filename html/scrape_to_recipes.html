<h2>Scrape Metadata and Create Recipes</h2>
<p><i>This operation requires administrator privileges on Windows</i></p>
<p>Provide a directory containing roms and produce 'recipe folders'. The tool uses the excellent Skyscraper under the hood to do
download information and covers for the roms.</p>
<p>This operation is useful where you have a set of roms which you want to turn into UCEs but have some need to tweak
the contents of the UCEs before they are built. This usually means applying a custom save partition. If you don't care
about this and just want UCEs, use 'Scrape To UCEs' from the main menu.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Dir:</b> <i>Required</i> A directory containing one/multiple roms for a single emulated system.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> The directory in which a recipe dir for each rom will be placed. If one
        isn't provided it will be created in the same directory as the roms.</li>
    <li><b>Core Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The path to a libretro core (emulator) file compatible with the roms in the
    input directory.</li>
    <li><b>Bios Dir</b> <i>Optional</i> Any files in this directory will be placed in the 'roms' directory within
    the UCE. This is mostly useful for adding the same bios file(s) to all recipes.</li>
    <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the roms belong to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose 'mame-libretro').
    Just because a platform is listed here it doesn't mean an appropriate core exists. It's been left on the long side
        as a modest nod to future-proofing.</li>
    <li><b>Scrape Module</b> <i>Required</i> The online source from which to scrape metadata. Each has a website if you
    need to know more. Some (e.g. the superb screenscraper) work a lot faster with a user account. arcadedb is excellent,
        requires no account but as the name suggests is relevant mostly for arcade roms.</li>
    <li><b>User Name</b> <i>Optional</i> A user name if you are using a module for which you have an account.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> <i>Optional</i> A password for any user account.</li>
    <li><b>Refresh Rom Data</b> <i>Optional</i> Select to re-download metadata and images for input roms. Do this if
        the tool is not producing a folder of marquees as expected.</li>
</ul>
