<h2>Scrape Metadata and Create Gamelist</h2>
<p>Provide a directory containing roms and produce an EmulationStation compatible gamelist.xml (the sort used by RetroPie
amongst others). Only the data required to produce UCEs (titles, descriptions, covers) will be downloaded. The tool uses
the excellent Skyscraper under the hood to do this.</p>
<p>This is functionality is provided because it's a step in the process from getting from a directory of roms to either
recipes or UCEs, and it was straightforward to break it out. If you are interested in building gamelists, especially for
uses other than building UCEs, then using either Skyscraper itself or a GUI tool like Skraper is probably a better option.
Both provide much more control over what is downloaded and how it is formatted.</p>
