<h2>Scrape Metadata and Build UCEs</h2>
<p><i>This operation requires administrator privileges on Windows</i></p>
<p>The most complete and user-friendly option for creating UCEs but lacking some of the flexibility possible from
chaining the individual steps.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Dir:</b> <i>Required</i> A directory containing one/multiple roms for a single emulated system.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> The directory in which the output UCE files will be placed. If no directory
    is provided one will be created in the same directory as the roms (called 'UCE').</li>
    <li><b>Core Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The path to a libretro core (emulator) file compatible with the roms in the
    input directory.</li>
    <li><b>Bios Dir</b> <i>Optional</i> Any files in this directory will be placed in the 'roms' directory within
    the UCE. This is mostly useful for adding the same bios file(s) to all recipes.</li>
    <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the roms belong to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose 'mame-libretro').
    Just because a platform is listed here it doesn't mean an appropriate core exists. It's been left on the long side
        as a modest nod to future-proofing.</li>
    <li><b>Scrape Module</b> <i>Required</i> The online source from which to scrape metadata. Each has a website if you
    need to know more. Some (e.g. the superb screenscraper) work a lot faster with a user account. arcadedb is excellent,
        requires no account but as the name suggests is relevant mostly for arcade roms.</li>
    <li><b>User Name</b> <i>Optional</i> A user name if you are using a module for which you have an account.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> <i>Optional</i> A password for any user account.</li>
    <li><b>Refresh Rom Data</b> <i>Optional</i> Select to re-download metadata and images for input roms. Do this if
        the tool is not producing a folder of marquees as expected.</li>
</ul>
