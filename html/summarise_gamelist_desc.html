<h2>Create summary of gamelist.xml</h2>

<p>Creates files containing lists and a table showing what data/assets have been successfully scraped for each game.
This is particularly useful when building recipes as it lets you determine which need further work before they
are built into UCEs.</p>

<p>Summaries can be created as part of many of the other scraping and building operations, so this will be rarely
needed on its own.</p>
