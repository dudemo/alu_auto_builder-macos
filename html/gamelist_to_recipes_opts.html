<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The gamelist.xml file from which to generate the recipes.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> A directory in which to place the output recipes. If this is not provided,
        a directory will be created in the same directory as the gamelist.xml.
    </li>
    <li><b>Core Path:</b> <i>Required</i> The path to a libretro core (emulator) file compatible with the roms referred
        to in the gamelist.xml
    </li>
    <li><b>Bios Dir</b> <i>Optional</i> Any files in this directory will be placed in the 'roms' directory within
        the UCE. This is mostly useful for adding the same bios file(s) to all recipes built from the gamelist.xml.
    </li>
    <li><b>Export Cox Assets</b> <i>Optional</i> Export a folder of assets which can be directly copied to a USB
        stick for use wit CoinOpsX. Videos are not guaranteed to work as ATGames products are quite picky about
        video formats.
    </li>
    <li><b>Export BitPixel Marquees</b> <i>Optional</i> Export a folder of marquee files resized for use with the
        BitPixel.
        These are in addition to any full size marquees exported for CoinOpsX (if selected).
    </li>
    <li><b>Do Summarise Gamelist</b> <i>Optional</i> Choose whether to create files containing lists and a table showing
        what data/assets have been successfully scraped for each game. This is particularly useful when building recipes
        as it lets you determine which need further work before they are built into UCEs.
    </li>
</ul>
