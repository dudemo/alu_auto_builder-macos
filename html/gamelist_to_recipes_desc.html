<h2>Create Recipes from gamelist.xml</h2>

<p>Takes an EmulationStation format gamelist.xml (the sort used by RetroPie, amongst others) and uses it to generate
'recipe' directories, from which UCEs can be built. If you just want to make UCEs without, for example, creating
custom save partitions then use 'Gamelist To Uces' from the main menu.</p>
<p>You can use a gamelist.xml produced with this tool or one produced by something else. However, in the latter case,
the gamelist.xml must point to actual roms and covers to work (if you're using it for something else, it probably does).
