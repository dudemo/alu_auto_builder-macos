<h2>Create UCEs from gamelist.xml</h2>

<p>Takes an EmulationStation format gamelist.xml (the sort used by RetroPie, amongst others) and uses it to generate
UCE files.</p>
<p>You can use a gamelist.xml produced with this tool or one produced by something else. However, in the latter case,
the gamelist.xml must point to actual roms and covers to work (if you're using it for something else, it probably does).
