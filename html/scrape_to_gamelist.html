<h2>Scrape Metadata and Create Gamelist</h2>
<p>Provide a directory containing roms and produce an EmulationStation compatible gamelist.xml (the sort used by RetroPie
amongst others). Only the data required to produce UCEs (titles, descriptions, covers) will be downloaded. The tool uses
the excellent Skyscraper under the hood to do this.</p>
<p>This is functionality is provided because it's a step in the process from getting from a directory of roms to either
recipes or UCEs, and it was straightforward to break it out. If you are interested in building gamelists, especially for
uses other than building UCEs, then using either Skyscraper itself or a GUI tool like Skraper is probably a better option.
Both provide much more control over what is downloaded and how it is formatted.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Input Dir:</b> <i>Required</i> A directory containing one/multiple roms for a single emulated system.</li>
    <li><b>Output Dir:</b> <i>Optional</i> The directory in which the gamelist.xml and a 'media' directory containing
        downloaded covers will be placed. If one isn't provided it will be created in the same directory as the roms.</li>
    <li><b>Platform</b> <i>Required</i> The platform/system the roms belong to (e.g. for MAME2003 choose 'mame-libretro').
    Just because a platform is listed here it doesn't mean an appropriate core exists. It's been left on the long side
        as a modest nod to future-proofing.</li>
    <li><b>Scrape Module</b> <i>Required</i> The online source from which to scrape metadata. Each has a website if you
    need to know more. Some (e.g. the superb screenscraper) work a lot faster with a user account. arcadedb is excellent,
        requires no account but as the name suggests is relevant mostly for arcade roms.</li>
    <li><b>User Name</b> <i>Optional</i> A user name if you are using a module for which you have an account.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> <i>Optional</i> A password for any user account.</li>
</ul>
